    <h3>Gani Fawehinmi Park - Ojota, Lagos-Nigeria</h3>
    <p>My travel tour to great Gani Fawehinmi park in Ojota. <br> <br> The statue in the park is dedicate to an international activist of repute and defender of rights and justice.</p>

    <p>This is a symbolic park named after the iconic legend, <a href="#">Chief Gani Fawehinmi.</a> A lawyer per excellence and an advocate for the common man.<br> Today, the park service is serving as a melting pot for all struggles emanating in the mega city (Lagos). In <i><b>2010,</b></i> a park in Ojota was named after him by the <b>Lagos State Government</b></p>

    <p>By Adeyinka 2022-05-19<br><br> I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment I'm really proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Gani Fawehinmi.<br> He was a man of honor and justice. <br><br> The park had beautiful sceneries though it needs more security beacuse of the Ojota opportunists. It requires maintenance too. But overall I loved it. </p>
